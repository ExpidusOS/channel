# ExpidusOS Channel

The ExpidusOS Channel is the nix channel which provides the declarative configuration for ExpidusOS.
This is built to use nix's Flakes for improved functionality and ships with home-manager to make user
management easier.

**Note**: at the current state, this is an early alpha version and it is recommended that people with
the required skills should use it.
